INCOMPLETE: The task is far from done. Only 4 of 10 required source files were created (config.py, db.py, utils.py, riot_api.py). The following 6 files from the PRD are entirely missing:

1. src/collect_players.py - Player collection script
2. src/collect_matches.py - Match collection script
3. src/collect_mastery.py - Mastery collection script
4. src/analyze.py - Analysis script (core deliverable)
5. src/visualize.py - Visualization/charting script
6. src/export_csv.py - CSV export script

The worker's own summary acknowledges these as "NEXT STEPS" and did not create work-complete.txt. The foundation modules (config, db, utils, riot_api) appear reasonable but the project has no runnable functionality yet — none of the CLI scripts exist, no analysis can be performed, no charts or CSVs can be generated.

Please implement ALL remaining scripts. Prioritize getting them all created so the full pipeline exists end-to-end. Each script must match the CLI interface, functionality, and output format specified in the PRD.
