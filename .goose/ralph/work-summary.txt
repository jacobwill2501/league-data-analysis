Completed foundational setup for League of Legends Champion Mastery Analysis project:

CREATED STRUCTURE:
- src/ directory with modular architecture
- data/, output/charts, output/csv, output/analysis directories
- requirements.txt with all dependencies
- .gitignore configured

IMPLEMENTED CORE MODULES:

1. src/config.py - Complete configuration system
   - API key management (RIOT_API_KEY env variable)
   - Region definitions (NA, EUW, KR) with platform/routing values
   - Elo filter configurations (emerald_plus, diamond_plus, diamond2_plus)
   - Mastery bucket definitions (low <10k, medium 10k-100k, high 100k+)
   - Production and dev key rate limits per endpoint group
   - All constants and configuration helpers

2. src/db.py - Full SQLite database layer
   - Complete schema with 5 tables (players, match_ids, match_participants, champion_mastery, collection_progress)
   - All indexes for performance
   - Context manager for connection handling
   - CRUD operations for all entities
   - Helper methods for analysis (filtered matches, stats summary)
   - Progress tracking for resumable collection

3. src/utils.py - Utility functions
   - Logging setup with console and file handlers
   - PatchManager class for fetching/caching patch versions from Data Dragon
   - ChampionMapper class for ID<->name mapping
   - Helper functions (format_duration, calculate_win_rate, etc.)
   - Output directory creation

4. src/riot_api.py - Riot API client with sophisticated rate limiting
   - Thread-safe RateLimiter class with sliding window tracking
   - Per (endpoint_group, region) rate limit tracking
   - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
   - 429 (rate limit) handling with Retry-After headers
   - All endpoint methods (league-v4, summoner-v4, match-v5, champion-mastery-v4)
   - Session-based connection pooling

5. src/__init__.py - Package initialization

NEXT STEPS:
- Implement data collection scripts (collect_players.py, collect_matches.py, collect_mastery.py)
- Implement analysis script (analyze.py)
- Implement visualization script (visualize.py)
- Implement CSV export script (export_csv.py)

The foundation is solid and ready for the data collection pipeline.
